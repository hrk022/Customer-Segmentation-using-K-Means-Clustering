# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the use of **K-Means Clustering** for customer segmentation. We apply unsupervised learning techniques to group customers based on their features and purchasing behavior. It includes PCA for visualization, elbow method to find optimal clusters, and silhouette score to evaluate clustering quality.
